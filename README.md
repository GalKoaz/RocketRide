Passengers and drivers can choose the participants that suit them best through a rating system.
The system is intended for drivers who are looking for passengers to join them on the trip to share in the fuel expenses and, of course, for anyone who is looking for a way other than public transportation or a private vehicle to make it easier to get to their destination.
Drivers can request passengers based on a variety of criteria including distance, location, and driver and passenger preference
The participants in the system are called drivers and riders. Drivers have a car and are willing to share it with people in exchange for gas money.
